# Causal Structure Learning

- **Causal_Discovery_RL**: code, datasets, and training logs of the experimental results for the paper
 ['Causal discovery with reinforcement learning'](https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1g2skStPB), ICLR, 2020. (oral)
- **GAE_Causal_Structure_Learning**: an implementation for ['A graph autoencoder approach to causal structure learning'](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07420), NeurIPS Causal Machine Learning Workshop, 2019.
- **Datasets**: 
    - Synthetic datasets: codes for generating synthetic datasets used in the paper.
    - Real datasets: a very challenging real dataset where the objective is to find causal structures based on 
    time series data. The true graph is obtained from expert knowledge. We welcome everyone to try this dataset and 
    report the result!
