# Trustworthy AI

This repository aims to include trustworthy AI related works from Huawei Noah's Ark Lab.  
Current projects include:

### gCastle

- This is a causal structure learning toolchain containing various functionality related to causal learning and evaluation. A tech report describing the toolbox is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15155).
- The package offers a number of causal discovery algorithms, most of which are gradient-based, hence the name: **g**radient-based **Ca**usal **st**ructure **le**arning pipeline.
- The real datasets (id:10, 21, 22) used in [PCIC Causal Discovery Competition 2021 ](https://competition.huaweicloud.com/information/1000041487/introduction) have been online:[link](https://github.com/gcastle-hub/dataset).

### Research 
 
- we'll progressively put some self-research achievements related to causality in this folder.
- Notes: For the simplicity, we have adjusted the structure of the old repository, in which we moved the previous 
  directories 'Causal_Structure_Learning' and 'Causal_Disentangled_Representation_Learning' the 'research' folder.
