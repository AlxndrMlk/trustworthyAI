# Trustworthy AI

This repository aims to include trustworthy AI related works from Huawei Noah's Ark Lab.  

### gCastle

- This is a causal structure learning toolchain containing various functionality related to causal learning and evaluation. A tech report describing the toolbox is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15155).
- The package offers a number of causal discovery algorithms, most of which are gradient-based, hence the name: **g**radient-based **Ca**usal **st**ructure **le**arning pipeline.

### Datasets
- Contains code for generating synthetic datasets and real-world datasets that we have open-sourced.

### Research 
 
- We progressively add self-research achievements related to causality here.
- Currently contains implementations of CausalVAE, GAE, and causal discovery with reinforcement learning.
