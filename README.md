# Trustworthy AI

This repository aims to include trustworthy AI related works from Huawei Noah's Ark Lab.  
Current works include:

### gCastle

- This is a causal structure learning toolchain containing various functionality related to causal learning and evaluation. A tech report describing the toolbox is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15155).
- The package offers a number of causal discovery algorithms, most of which are gradient-based, hence the name: **g**radient-based **Ca**usal **st**ructure **le**arning pipeline.

### Research 
 
- we'll progressively put some self-research achievements related to causality in this folder.
- **Notes**: For the simplicity and clean, we have adjusted the structure of the old repository, in which we moved the previous directories 'Causal_Structure_Learning' and 'Causal_Disentangled_Representation_Learning' the 'research' folder.
